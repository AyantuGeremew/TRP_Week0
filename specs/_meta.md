# Project Meta: Project Chimera (Autonomous Influencer Network)

## 1.1 Vision
To transition from manual content scheduling to a scalable fleet of **Autonomous Influencer Agents**.These are goal-directed digital entities capable of perception, reasoning, creative expression, and on-chain economic agency.

## 1.2 Core Constraints
* **Architecture:** Hub-and-Spoke model using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for external connectivity and a **FastRender Swarm** (Planner/Worker/Judge) for internal logic.
* **Governance:** "Management by Exception." Human intervention (HITL) is required only for low-confidence tasks or high-risk topics.
* **Economic Agency:** Agents must manage their own P&L via **Coinbase AgentKit**.
* **Compliance:** Strict adherence to AI transparency laws (e.g., EU AI Act) and self-disclosure.
