# Project Chimera: AI Agent Operational Rules

## 1. Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system. We are building goal-directed digital entities that research, create, and manage content autonomously.

## 2. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
- **NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.** 
- The `specs/` directory is the ONLY source of truth for architecture and logic.

## 3. Planning & Traceability
- You must explain your plan in the chat before modifying any files.
- Ensure **Tenx MCP Sense** is active to record your "Thinking Trace".
- Distinguish between **Skills** (local functions like `download_video`) and **MCP Servers** (external bridges).

## 4. Architectural Standards
- Follow the **FastRender Swarm** pattern: Planner (Strategist), Worker (Executor), Judge (Gatekeeper).
- All external data must be fetched via **MCP Resources**.
- All financial actions must use **Coinbase AgentKit** and respect the $50 USDC daily budget.
