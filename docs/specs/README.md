- **Connectivity:** Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Commerce:** Coinbase AgentKit for on-chain financial autonomy.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **/docs/specs**: Source of truth for Spec-Driven Development (SDD).
- **/docs/research**: Intelligence gathering on the Agent Social Network (OpenClaw).
- **/infrastructure**: Dockerized agent workloads and MCP server configurations.
- **/skills**: Specialized agent capabilities (e.g., content generation, trend analysis).
- **/mcp-servers**: Bridges to external APIs (Twitter, Coinbase, Weaviate).

## 🛠 Setup & Governance
- **Environment:** Managed via `uv`.
- **Guardrails:** All transactions are governed by a "CFO" Judge agent.
- **Identity:** Personas defined via `SOUL.md` standards.
